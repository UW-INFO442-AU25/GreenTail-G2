# GreenTail-G2
GreenTail is a sustainable pet food verification tool (SDG 12). We use a custom Eco-Score to help dog/cat owners cut through "greenwashing" and find the most environmentally responsible products that fit their budget. Features include a 5-step Onboarding Quiz and personalized product recommendations.
