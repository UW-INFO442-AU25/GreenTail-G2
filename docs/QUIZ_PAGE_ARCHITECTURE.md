## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Functional Issue**: Primary CTA button needs verification
2. **Content Depth**: Lacks supporting information about the quiz process
3. **Trust Building**: Missing social proof and credibility elements
4. **User Expectations**: No clear information about quiz length or question types
5. **Engagement**: Limited to single CTA without secondary engagement points

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Hero Section (P0 - Immediate)
**Priority**: Critical
**Goal**: Fix functionality and improve CTA effectiveness

**Changes**:
- Verify and ensure CTA button functionality (`handleStartQuiz`)
- Update headline: "Find Your Perfect Pet Food Match"
- Add sub-headline: "Our quick and easy quiz analyzes your pet's needs to recommend ideal organic food options."
- Update button text: "Start The 90-Second Quiz"
- Add microcopy below button: "5 simple steps. Personalized results."
- Maintain existing feature tags with improved styling

### Phase 2: How It Works Section (P1 - Short-term)
**Priority**: High
**Goal**: Demystify the quiz process and set expectations

**Content**:
1. **Answer**: "Tell us about your pet's age, size, dietary needs, and your sustainability priorities."
2. **Analyze**: "Our algorithm scores products on environmental impact, nutrition, and value."
3. **Discover**: "Get personalized organic food recommendations that match your pet's needs and your budget."

**Design**:
- Icon-based visual representation (similar to HomePage)
- Horizontal layout for desktop, vertical for mobile
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations

### Phase 3: Social Proof Section (P2 - Mid-term)
**Priority**: Medium
**Goal**: Build trust and credibility

**Content**:
- **Testimonials**: 1-2 short, impactful quotes from users
  - Example: "The quiz helped me find organic options that fit my budget. My dog loves the recommendations!" - Sarah M.
- **Trust Badge**: Display usage statistics
  - Example: "Join 5,000+ pet parents who found their perfect organic match!"

**Design**:
- Clean card-based layout
- Testimonials with user avatars (optional) or initials
- Trust badge with prominent number display

## Technical Implementation Details

### Animation Strategy
Following the same pattern as HomePage and AboutPage:
- **Initial Load**: Staggered animations for hero section elements
- **Scroll Triggered**: How It Works and Social Proof sections use Intersection Observer
- **Micro-interactions**: Button hover effects, smooth transitions
- **Performance**: Only transform and opacity (hardware accelerated)

### State Management
- Continue using existing QuizContext
- No additional state needed for landing page
- Quiz data collection happens in Quiz1-Quiz5

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Horizontal scroll for feature tags on mobile
- Stacked layout for How It Works on mobile

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements have aria-labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion
